Thank you for applying, and there is always the opportunity to try again in a month.

The reason your application was not accepted cannot be disclosed, however here are some common reasons:

Answers that are too short/vague
Lack of moderator experience
Inappropiate scenario action
Can't be as active as other applicants
Unprofessionalism in the application
Inactivity in the server

                break;

            .setColor("GREEN")
            .setDescription(`Successfully denied!`);

        interaction.reply({ embeds: [successMessageEmbed], ephemeral: true });
    },
};
